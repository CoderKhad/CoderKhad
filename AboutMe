Hi there! I'm Khadija, a driven and passionate aspiring software engineer with a foundation in C, C++, and HTML. 
Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by learning Python and possibly thinking about exploring the exciting world of data science. With two years of experience under my belt and an Associate's degree in Science and Mathematics from ASC (Class of 2022)my local hometown college, I'm eager to continue growing and making meaningful contributions in the tech industry. 
When I'm not coding or learning, you can find me sharing snippets of my life on Instagram (@kx.dija( https://www.instagram.com/kx.dija?igsh=MWxoejlxcGczbndmeA==) ) or connecting with others via email (khadijaflem14@). 
Let's connect and build something amazing together!
